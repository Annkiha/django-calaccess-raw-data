# Django Calaccess Parser *(in active development)*

Download, extract and load the [CAL-ACCESS](http://www.sos.ca.gov/prd/cal-access/) campaign finance and lobbying activity database.

## Requirements
- Python 2.7
- MySQL 5.5

*If you want to use the campaign finance app:*
- Node 0.10.25
- npm 1.3.x
- grunt-cli
- bower

The project is structured using the Datadesk [django project template](https://github.com/datadesk/django-project-template). Check out that codebase to understand how this project is setup.

## Installation
First, setup a virtual environment for the project.

__With virtualenv__
```bash
$ cd my-virtual-envs
$ virtualenv --no-site-packages calaccess
$ cd calaccess
$ . bin/activate
```

__With [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)__
```bash
$ mkvirtualenv calaccess
```

Clone the repo, install the dependecies, and configure the project 
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:california-civic-data-coalition/django-calaccess-parser.git
$ cd django-calaccess-parser
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cp project/settings_dev.template project/settings_dev.py
```
### Database setup
If you haven't already, create a MySQL user and database to store the CAL Access data and add it to `settings_dev.py`. This should look something like:
```bash
$ mysql -uroot
```
```sql
CREATE DATABASE local_calaccess_db;
CREATE USER 'calaccessuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* To 'calaccessuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

```

:rotating_light: __HEADS UP__: Ensure that `DEBUG` is set to `False` and `local_infile:1` is added to the database tuple in your `settings_dev.py` file __BEFORE__ you run the load commands (See [settings_dev.template](https://github.com/california-civic-data-coalition/django-calaccess-parser/blob/master/project/settings_dev.template) for an example). Otherwise, when MySQL throws a warning or error, the Django ORM will stop the data load. Be sure to return `DEBUG` to `True` later when doing active development on the application.

### Loading the data

Next, sync the database, create a Django admin user, and run the management command to the load the CAL Access data 
```bash
$ python manage.py syncdb
$ python manage.py downloadaccess
```

:warning: This'll take a while. Go grab some coffee or do something else productive with your life.

## Setting up the Campaign Finance app

The campaign finance app tracks the spending and cashflow candidates, PACs, and organizations.
:warning: This'll take a while. Go grab *another* coffee or do something else productive with your life.
```bash
$ python manage.py build_campaign_finance
```


### Setup search
Search isn't really wired up yet but we can use [Haystack's](http://django-haystack.readthedocs.org/en/latest/toc.html) dummy search for now. Go ahead and build the index to search against.
```bash
$ python manage.py rebuild_index
```

### Setup Node, Npm, Grunt and Bower 
Everything should be good now (Go ahead and set `DEBUG` to `True` in `settings_dev.py`). Let's install the required Grunt tasks and JavaScript libraries. 

If you don't have node.js installed, go ahead and run the following fab commands:
```bash
$ fab install_node
$ fab get_node_libs
```

With that installed, let's download our frontend dependencies:
```bash
$ npm install && bower install
```

### Running the Campaign Finance app

Fire up the server and get our Grunt tasks running.
```bash 
fab rs
```

In a new terminal window, start Grunt tasks from the project root
```bash
grunt
```
Now browse to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to see the app in action
